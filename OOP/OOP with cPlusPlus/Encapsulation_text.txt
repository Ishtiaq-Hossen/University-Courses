Access specifiers in c++
1. public --> we can use it from outside
2. private --> we can't use it from outside
3. protected --> we will know about it at inheritance 


#Private data will be hidden from other classes 
and they can only be accessed through 
public function of their current class.
That is known as data hiding

class Encap
{
    public:
        int roll;
        void display()
        {
            //-----
        }
    private:
        string name;
    protected:
        float gpa;
};

#Encapsulation
Encapsulation is process of 
1. Combining variables and funcions in a single unit(class)
2. Protecting data by declaring them as private

//for accessing private things we will need setter & getter function
