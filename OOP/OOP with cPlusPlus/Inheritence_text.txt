#Inheritence : The process of obtaining the data members and functions from one class to another class is known as inhertence.

Importance:
    #code reusability 
    #Application development time is less
    #Application take less memory 
    #Application execuation time is less.


There are 5 types of inheritence in c++
    1)Single inheritence 
    2)Multilevel inheritence 
    3)Hierarchical inheritance
    4)Hybrid inheritence
    5)Hybrid inheritence 


1)Single inheritence 

A<-B 
In this sort of inheritence 
one subclass inherit from one superclass.

class A
{
    .........
    .........
};
class B: public A
{
    .........
    .........
};

2)Multilevel inheritence

In this sort of inheritence the superclass 
for one is the subclass for 
one is the subclass for another.

class A
{
    .....
    .....
};
class B:public A
{
    .....
    .....
};
class C:public B
{
    .....
    .....
};


3)Hierarchical inheritance 

A<-B
A<-C 
A<-D 

IN this sort of inheritence multiple subclass derived from
single superclass 

class A 
{
    .....
    .....
};
class B:public A
{
    .....
    .....
};
class C:public A 
{
    .....
    .....
};

4)Multiple inheritence 
A<-B 
A<-C 
B<-D 
C<-D 

In multiple inheritence a class can 
inherit more than one class.

In this type of inheritence a single 
child class can have multiple parent classes.


5)Hybrid inheritence 
Hybrid inheritence is a combination of more than one type 
of inheritence.
